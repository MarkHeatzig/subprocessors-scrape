Company,Sub-processor,Service category / What they do
Cursor,AWS,"Our infrastructure is primarily hosted on AWS. Most of our servers are in the US, with some latency-critical servers located in AWS regions in (Tokyo) and Europe (London)."
Cursor,Cloudflare,We use Cloudflare as a reverse proxy in front of parts of our API and website in order to improve performance and security.
Cursor,Microsoft Azure,Some secondary infrastructure is hosted on Microsoft Azure. All of our Azure servers are in the US.
Cursor,Google Cloud Platform (GCP),Some secondary infrastructure is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All of our GCP servers are in the US.
Cursor,Fireworks,"Our custom models are hosted with Fireworks, on servers in the US, Asia (Tokyo), and Europe. Fireworks may store some code data if privacy mode is disabled to speed up inference for our models. We have a zero data retention agreement with Fireworks."

Cursor,Exa,"Used for web search functionality. Search requests are potentially derived from code data (e.g. when using ""@web"" in the chat, a separate language model will look at your message, conversation history and current file to determine what to search for, and Exa/SerpApi will see the resulting search query)."
Cursor,SerpApi,"Used for web search functionality. Search requests are potentially derived from code data (e.g. when using ""@web"" in the chat, a separate language model will look at your message, conversation history and current file to determine what to search for, and Exa/SerpApi will see the resulting search query)."

Windsurf,Google Cloud Platform (GCP),"Usage analytics and logs are primarily hosted on GCP. These are located in the same region as the compute used for model inference. We also use GCP to host retained data under Enterprise Cloud plans if the opt-in has been selected for corresponding features (ex. remote indexing, organizational best practices, etc). This data retention happens in the customer tenant for the Enterprise Hybrid plans and therefore not within our instance of GCP."
Windsurf,Crusoe,"We manage Crusoe's compute for training some of our custom models, as well as hosting some of our custom models."
