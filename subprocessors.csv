Company,Sub-processor,Service category / What they do
Cursor,AWS,"Our infrastructure is primarily hosted on AWS. Most of our servers are in the US, with some latency-critical servers located in AWS regions in (Tokyo) and Europe (London)."
Cursor,Microsoft Azure,Some secondary infrastructure is hosted on Microsoft Azure. All of our Azure servers are in the US.
Cursor,Google Cloud Platform (GCP),Some secondary infrastructure is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All of our GCP servers are in the US.
Cursor,Fireworks,"Our custom models are hosted with Fireworks, on servers in the US, Asia (Tokyo), and Europe. Fireworks may store some code data if privacy mode is disabled to speed up inference for our models. We have a zero data retention agreement with Fireworks."
Cursor,OpenAI,We rely on many of OpenAI's models to give AI responses. Requests may be sent to OpenAI even if you have an Anthropic (or someone else's) model selected in chat (e.g. for summarization). We have a zero data retention agreement with OpenAI.
Cursor,Anthropic,We rely on many of Anthropic's models to give AI responses. Requests may be sent to Anthropic even if you have an OpenAI (or someone else's) model selected in chat (e.g. for summarization). We have a zero data retention agreement with Anthropic.
Cursor,Google Cloud Vertex API,We rely on some Gemini models offered over Google Cloud's Vertex API to give AI responses. Requests may be sent to Google Cloud Vertex API even if you have an OpenAI (or someone else's) model selected in chat (e.g. for summarization). We have a zero data retention agreement with Vertex.
Cursor,xAI,We rely on some Grok models offered over the xAI API to give AI responses. We have a zero data retention agreement with xAI.
Cursor,Turbopuffer,"Embeddings of indexed codebases, as well as metadata associated with the embeddings (obfuscated file names), are stored with Turbopuffer on Google Cloud's servers in the US. You can read more on the Turbopuffer security page. Users can disable codebase indexing; read more about it in the Codebase Indexing section of this document."
Cursor,Exa,"Used for web search functionality. Search requests are potentially derived from code data (e.g. when using ""@web"" in the chat, a separate language model will look at your message, conversation history and current file to determine what to search for, and Exa/SerpApi will see the resulting search query)."
Cursor,SerpApi,"Used for web search functionality. Search requests are potentially derived from code data (e.g. when using ""@web"" in the chat, a separate language model will look at your message, conversation history and current file to determine what to search for, and Exa/SerpApi will see the resulting search query)."
Cursor,MongoDB,"We use MongoDB for some of our analytics data, for users who do not have privacy mode enabled."
Cursor,Datadog,"We use Datadog for logging and monitoring. As discussed in the Privacy Mode Guarantee section, logs related to privacy mode users do not contain any code data."
Cursor,Databricks,We use Databricks MosaicML for training some of our custom models. Data from privacy mode users never reaches Databricks.
Cursor,Foundry,We use Foundry for training some of our custom models. Data from privacy mode users never reaches Foundry.
Cursor,Voltage Park,We use Voltage Park for training some of our custom models. Data from privacy mode users never reaches Voltage Park.
Cursor,Slack,We use Slack as our internal communication tool. We may send snippets of prompts of non-privacy users in our internal chats for debugging.
Cursor,Google Workspace,We use Google Workspace to collaborate. We may send snippets of prompts of non-privacy users in our internal emails for debugging.
Cursor,Sentry,"We use Sentry to monitor errors and performance in our app. Code data is never explicitly sent, but may show up in reported errors. Data from privacy mode users never reaches Sentry."
Cursor,Mistral,We use Mistral to parse public PDFs found on the internet. No private data reaches Mistral (unless you manually use a Mistral model with your own API key).
Cursor,Pinecone,Embeddings and metadata of some indexed docs are stored on Pinecone. These docs are fetched from the public web.
Cursor,Amplitude,"We use Amplitude for some of our analytics data. No code data is stored with Amplitude; only event data such as ""number of Cursor Tab requests""."
Cursor,HashiCorp,We use HashiCorp Terraform to manage our infrastructure.
Cursor,Stripe,"We use Stripe to handle billing. Stripe will store your personal data (name, credit card, address)."
Cursor,Vercel,We use Vercel to deploy our website. The website has no way of accessing code data.
Cursor,WorkOS,"We use WorkOS to handle auth. WorkOS may store some personal data (name, email address)."
